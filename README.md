### **Description**
The purpose of this app is to provide users with an easy to read, and informative way to view the different beers available to them from the Brewdog API. The cards are displayed in a grid format, which allows the user to scroll through the different beer cards, and view the information about each beer when the card is clicked.

- Brewdog Punk API

### **Functionality**
The two most vital parts of this app are the filter and the search functionality, because they determine the arrays of beers which can be sort through by the user. For this to happen, the beer array must be retrieved from the API. This is performed within the UserProvder.jsx where API requests are made by the `getBeerData()` function, depending on the string parameter inputted into the function, which changes the API URL request.

The app is hosted on firebase and users are currently able to register and login. 

### **Developments**
- Write functionality that allows users to login, browse the beers and create a favourites list
